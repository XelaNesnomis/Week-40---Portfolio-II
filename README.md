# Tic Tac Toe Assignment

Everything you need to complete this assignment is demonstrated in the provided code. You are to make the following changes:

1. Evaluate diagonal wins (currently, the code only evaluates orthogonal wins).
2. Evaluate for draw (i.e there are no more open cells and nobody has three in a row).
3. Remove all magic strings and numbers.
4. Support at least two languages.
5. Refactor and add code so that the player can change the game language via the menu -> settings.
6. Implement the necessary changes and additions to support Player vs Computer mode.  
   The current game is PvP (Player vs Player), but we want a functional Player vs Computer mode (accessed via the menu). The computer player you implement does not need to be smart, just functional. Note that there should still be a PvP mode, with PvC as an additional option.
7. Improve the gameboard's appearance and use colors for players (see `img1.png` for inspiration).
8. The player should not need to count from 0 in order to play (i.e. uper left hand corner should be 1 1 and center should be 2 2 for the player)
9. Update the splash screen graphics and include at least three colors.
10. Improve overall readability and maintainability by refactoring

Remember to solve one thing at a time: start by understanding the problem, make it work, then make it "pretty".   
If you create a bug, do not move on to something new, stick with it. Chances are, if you don't, you'll just create another bug elsewhere in the code, making it more complex to fix.


# "Harder" (Extra) Challenges
These are optional, and you should only attempt them once you've completed the other challenges. Solving them may require additional research. Do one, do all, or none at allâ€”it's completely your decision.

* Remember the language choice between sessions (i.e., across restarts of the program).
* Center the splash screen graphics in the terminal window (Hint: `process.stdout.columns`).
* Implement the Minimax algorithm for your computer player.
